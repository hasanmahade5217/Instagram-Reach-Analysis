# Instagram-Reach-Analysis

Instagram is a widely used social media platform where people, especially professionals, leverage it for business promotion, portfolio showcasing, blogging, and content creation. Given the dynamic nature of Instagram and its continuous updates, the algorithm changes impact the visibility of our posts, influencing long-term success. For content creators aiming for sustained success, it's crucial to analyze their Instagram reach data regularly.

For this analysis purpose I have collected the data from the instagram account of [statso.io](https://www.instagram.com/statso.io/). This dataset is available for free download Below are all the features in the data:

- Impressions: Number of impressions in a post (Reach)
- From Home: Reach from home
- From Hashtags: Reach from Hashtags
- From Explore: Reach from Explore
- From Other: Reach from other sources
- Saves: Number of saves
- Comments: Number of comments
- Shares: Number of shares
- Likes: Number of Likes
- Profile Visits: Numer of profile visits from the post
- Follows: Number of Follows from the post
- Caption: Caption of the post
- Hashtags: Hashtags used in the post

Through this exploratory data analysis (EDA) I will try to answer the folowing questions. Later I will use Machine Learning to predict the number of reach based on the attributes available in the dataset.
